HyperMem Info
===========

A Light and High QPS Text2Mem Cache.Pure C for Core Function,NodeJs for Middleware.

Interface Tutorial 
===========
Top 3 tech:

1,The fastest hash algorithm created by Blizzard Co'Ltd.I use it into this project.

2,The fastest text read method [mmap or share memeor ] by Pure C language.

3,The fastest Socket Handle pthread by EPOLL [ Linux 2.6+ / libevent ].


I wrote it upon top 3 technique and for the most Convenient outer user can use it.I enclosure it by NodeJs.

By net module and long-connection,the whole proj can exert it max performance.

I test on the HP585 server machine [16C/32G] and test 40000~50000 QPS.

Though it cann't compared by memcache,but it can support other job or work conveniently.
